Adprog BASIC CRUD Web App Assignment

if(user == 'Professor')
	print('Hello Sir')
else
	print('You may expect some hardcore back-end codes now but for the front-end,
	expect the other way around')

Instructions :

	Create your own database but here's how to do it in order for it to synchronize
	with this web app (just copy-paste it if you want):
		create database cardb;
		create table cars(
			id int auto_increment unique,
			make varchar(50) not null,
			model varchar(50) not null,
			year int not null,
			plnum varchar(50) not null,
			cond enum('Brand New', 'Pre-Owned') not null,
			primary key(id)
		);
		create table users(
			username varchar(50) not null,
			password varchar(50) not null,
			auth varchar(5) not null,
			primary key(username)
		);

	Run the app directly(don't worry it contains middlewares[and instructions] that
	will indicate if your database is off or has a wrong password configured in your
	.env file and also indicates if your host is faulty)

	Start in localhost:5555 or localhost:1234

	Hope you'll enjoy it.
